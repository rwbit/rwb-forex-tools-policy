    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: October 28, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the RWB Forex Tools mobile application ("App") provided by RWB IT ("we," "us," or "our"). The App provides educational and reference tools for forex trading calculations, such as lot size, win/loss ratios, and risk/reward breakeven. The App is for educational purposes only and does not facilitate actual trading, brokerage, or financial advice. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App constitutes your acceptance of these Terms and any future modifications. You must be at least 18 years old or the legal age in your jurisdiction to use the App. If you are using the App on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>The App is provided for personal, non-commercial, educational use only. You may use it to perform offline calculations related to forex trading. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>• (a) use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose;</li>
      <li>• (b) modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or tamper with the App;</li>
      <li>• (c) distribute, reproduce, or create derivative works from the App without our written permission;</li>
      <li>• (d) use the App to provide financial advice or services to others;</li>
      <li>• (e) introduce viruses, malware, or any harmful code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, features, and functionality in the App, including text, graphics, logos, and software, are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for its intended educational purpose only.</p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties, express or implied, including accuracy, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose. Calculations are for educational reference only and should not be relied upon for actual trading decisions. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall we, our affiliates, or our developers be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including loss of profits, data, or trading losses. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App (if any). This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses (including attorney's fees) arising from your violation of these Terms or your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without notice, for any reason, including if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the App will cease immediately.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be effective upon posting in the App or via notification. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any legal action, dispute, or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the App shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in Singapore. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

    <h2>11. Compliance with Local Laws</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the App complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and rules in your country or jurisdiction, including any restrictions on forex trading or related activities. We make no representation that the App is appropriate or legal for use in all locations. If you access or use the App from a jurisdiction where forex trading or related activities are prohibited (including Bangladesh), you do so at your own risk and are fully responsible for compliance with local laws. We shall not be liable for any violation of local laws by you.</p>
