    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: October 28, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how RWB IT ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with the RWB Forex Tools mobile application ("App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. The App performs all calculations offline on your device and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this Policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information from you. The App does not require user accounts, logins, or any input of personal details such as name, email, location, or financial data. All calculations (e.g., lot size, win ratios) are processed locally on your device and are not shared with us or any third parties. We do not use cookies, trackers, or analytics tools.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any information, there is no usage of data. The App's functionality is entirely offline and self-contained.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any information to third parties because no data is collected. There are no integrations with social media, advertising networks, or external services.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>Although no data is collected, we take reasonable measures to ensure the App is secure from vulnerabilities. However, no system is completely secure, and you use the App at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware of such collection, we will take steps to delete it. Parents or guardians should supervise children's use of the App.</p>

    <h2>7. International Compliance</h2>
    <p>This Policy complies with applicable privacy laws, including but not limited to GDPR (for EU users) and CCPA (for California residents), to the extent relevant. Since no data is collected, there are no data subject rights requests to process, but you may contact us for any concerns.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted in the App or via notification. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:rwbit2015@gmail.com">rwbit2015@gmail.com</a></p>
